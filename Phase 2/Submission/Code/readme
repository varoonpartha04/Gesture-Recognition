1. Download python 3.8
2. Create a virtual environment with the command in the application folder:
        python3.8 -m venv env
3. Activate the environment
        source env/bin/activate 
4. Install all the requirements from the requirement.txt file to install all the dependencies
	    pip install -r requirements.txt 
5. Run task 0a
    python task0a.py

    Enter the directory path(relative or absolute)
    Enter resolution(integer)
    Enter window size(integer)
    Enter split size(integer)

6. Run task 0b
    python task0b.py

    Enter the directory path(relative or absolute)

6. Run task 1
    python task1.py

    Enter the directory path
    Choose one of vector recognition file: tf, tf-idf
    Choose one vector model: pca, svd, nmf, lda
    Choose number of components 

7. Run task 2
    python task2.py

    Enter the file name to compare
    Choose one of the user options

8. Run task 3
    python task3.py
    
    Choose one of the model from the user option to create gesture gesture similarity matrix
    Enter the number of components
    Choose one of the model from SVD or NMF to find the latent semantics

9. Run task 4ab
    python task4ab.py

    Choose which model to use from SVD and NMF. It is dependent of task3 so make sure you have choosen the same input in task3 as well.

10. Run task 4cd
    python task4cd.py

    Choose one of the models available
    Give the number of components
    Choose one of the clustering algorithm
